Admin Dashboard using CSS Grid and Theme Switching

## 3. Defined Approach
This experiment is implemented using CSS Grid to structure the dashboard layout into header, navigation, and main content sections. CSS variables are used to manage light and dark themes efficiently. JavaScript is used to toggle between themes and store the user’s selected preference in localStorage so that the theme persists even after refreshing the page.
